# Unroll

Unroll is a tool for viewing transport routes in OpenStreetMap. It allows you to search for transport routes and to display their details: attributes, trips, timetables, stops, shapes, etc.

* On OSM wiki, you can display a link to the Unroll page of a route with the [Unroll template](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Template:Unroll) : `{{Unroll|rel=3328765|label=Metro 6}}`
